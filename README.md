## Week 1: Plan

- Decide what game/app to make.
- Brainstorming.
- Decide programming language, frameworks etc to use for the project.
- Write Project Description.
- If snake game:
   - Research HTML and JS.
   - Use node or react?
   - Use heroku or github pages for hosting.

## Week 2: Develop

 - Have a first MVP (minimum viable playable) finished, a functioning version of the game that we can continue working on.
   - Make a playable canvas that has walls with collision.
   - Make the snake character and have it move automatically.
   - Add controlling the direction of the movement using user input.
   - Add collision to the snake, so the game ends when it tries to pass through itself.
   - Add apples that increase the size of the snake.

## Week 3: Develop & Review
- Make the game look better & add some funtionality
   - Add texture or color to canvas, snake and apples.
   - Keep track of apples eaten in the form of a counter or points.
   - Add additional functionality, like rotten apples that decrease the size of the snake or other food that adds more points.
   - Add different game modes: The snake can pass through walls, if it eats an apple the head and tail are switched etc.
